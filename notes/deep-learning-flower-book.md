#### Chapter 5 Challenges motivating Deep Learning 
* Limitations of traditional machine Learning
    * Difficulty to generalize 
    * inefficient of calculate complicated functions of high dimensions
* The Curses of Dimensionality 
    * In high-dimensional spaces, the number of configurations is huge, much larger than our number of examples. A typicl grid cell has no examples associted with it
* Local Constancy and Smoothness Regularization
